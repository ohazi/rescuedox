# rescuedox
A horizontally staggered split keyboard that uses a complete set of Ergodox keycaps

## Why?

### tl;dr
- I have a nice set of Ergodox keycaps
- I don't like the Ergodox layout
- I still want to use these keycaps

### Story?
In a fit of carpal tunnel induced wrist pain, I decided to try an ergonomic split keyboard. At the time, Ergodox was one of the more popular split keyboard designs on [r/mk](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/). Parts and (good) complete keycap sets were relatively easy to find, which was important because I really didn't want to go hunting for individual oddly-sized keycaps in oddly-specific colors and profiles to make a complete set. 

I over-eagerly bought a nice set of Ergodox keycaps ([SA Vilebloom](http://www.mechsupply.co.uk/product/sa-vilebloom)) before actually trying the Ergodox keyboard and realizing that I actually can't stand using it. 

#### What's wrong with Ergodox?
1. The columnar stagger doesn't actually help with wrist pain

    The argument for an ortholinear layout or a columnar stagger goes something like "when you extend your finger, it doesn't go sideways, does it? So why are the keys on your keyboard not directly on top of each other? The answer is archaic design." It's true that the traditional horizontally staggered keyboard layout comes from the typewriter. This stagger simplified the design of the lever array underneath the typewriter's keyboard. It's also true that your fingers don't move sideways when you move them up and down (duh?). 
    
    However, I'm not convinced that moving your fingers from side to side is actually associated with wrist pain. The muscle tendons that move your fingers up and down are routed through the carpal tunnel, which is a ring of bones and ligaments in your wrist. You can feel your carpal tunnel change shape as your tendons tighten and loosen by moving your fingers up and down while your other hand is wrapped around your wrist. But if you move your fingers from side to side, there is almost no change in tension or movement in the carpal tunnel. 

2. The columnar stagger is infuriating

    The QWERTY layout feels familiar, but the keys are offset *just* enough to make me miss when typing quickly. I've heard that you get used to this, but I'm not sure if getting used to this also means getting thrown off when returning to a computer with a standard keyboard layout (e.g. a laptop, a computer at work, someone else's computer). 
    
3. Programming keys are an afterthought

    When programming, the `` ` ``, `~`, `_`, `-`, `=`, `+`, `[`, `{`, `]`, `}`, `|`, `'`, and `"` symbols are heavily used. Obviously there are plenty of extra keys that these symbols *could* be mapped to, but the layout makes it difficult to map many of them anywhere close to their standard positions. So not only will you miss, you'll be on the wrong side of the keyboard, so correcting the miss will mean looking down, not seeing the key you wanted half a cm to the left, and then remembering that it's actually in your thumb cluster. I've wasted enough time being annoyed by cmd / ctrl muscle memory when switching between a Mac and a PC, and that's just one key... doing this with 20% of the keyboard doesn't seem like a good idea. 

#### Okay, so now what?
I still want to use these keycaps, but I want a keyboard with a slightly less insane layout. Short production run group buys being what they are, all other variants of this keycap set are completely sold out, so I probably won't be able to find the additional keys I'd need to fit most other keyboard designs. So this is a split keyboard designed for a complete set of Ergodox keycaps, but that arranges them using the more typical horizontal stagger. 


## Layout
The mockup image above represents the layout I currently have in mind, but this may change. 

### Layout Constraints
SA keycaps have a sculpted profile (keys in different rows have a slightly different shape):

I'd like the keys in the central area to use the correct key shape for their given row. This works out fine for the double-shot keys (letters, numbers, `,`, `.`, `/`, `;`) but places some constraints on the modifiers, tab, caps lock, shift, enter, backspace, `~`, `-`, `=`, `[`, `]`, `\`, and `'` keys. R2 and R4 keycaps are interchangable if the key can be placed upside-down. The arrow cluster currently uses the correct profile (R3 for left, down, right, and R4 for up), but I don't mind if these are all flat (R3). The quad above the arrow keys is currently all flat. The stack of keys on the far left is currently all flat (R3), except for an R2 at the top, even though this position would normally have an R1. None of the SA Vilebloom keycaps use R5, so all keys in the bottom position use R3 instead.
