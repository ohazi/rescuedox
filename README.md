Staggered split keyboard for Ergodox keycaps

## Why?
I over-eagerly bought a nice set of Ergodox keycaps before actually trying the keyboard and realizing that I don't like the columnar stagger. Low production run group buys being what they are, this keycap set is no longer available in any standard layout. I still want to use them though, so this is a split keyboard designed for a complete set of Ergodox keycaps, but that arranges them using a more typical horizontal stagger pattern.
